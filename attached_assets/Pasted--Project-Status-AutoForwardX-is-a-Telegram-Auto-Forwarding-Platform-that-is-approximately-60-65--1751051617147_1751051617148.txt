🚀 Project Status:
AutoForwardX is a Telegram Auto-Forwarding Platform that is approximately 60-65% complete.
Core forwarding, queue management, user authentication, payment systems, and the main user dashboard have been implemented.
The platform is stable but still missing essential admin controls, advanced management tools, and several critical user-facing and backend features.

✅ Core Objective:
The immediate goal is to complete the pending modules and build a fully controllable, self-healing, and admin-powered Telegram forwarding system.
The final version must offer real-time task management, joined channel selection, admin-level controls, SEO growth tools, bot language flexibility, and third-party webhook integrations.

📂 Detailed Feature Requirements:
1. 🛠️ Admin Panel (High Priority, Currently Missing)
Build a dark-themed, fully responsive Admin Dashboard using Tailwind CSS.

Admin Controls Required:

User Management: View, upgrade, suspend, and delete user accounts.

Session Monitoring: Real-time health status for each user’s Telegram sessions.

Manual Error Fixing: Force restart sessions, clear stuck queues, manually heal tasks.

Global Announcements: Send system-wide promotional messages to all Free Plan users’ destination channels.

Payment Management: View payment logs, update user plans manually.

Security: IP Whitelisting for admin panel access.

2. 📌 Joined Channel Selector (Currently Missing)
Build a visual joined channel selector in the user dashboard:

Search bar, multi-select dropdown, drag-and-drop UI.

Real-time Telegram channel status (joined, restricted, left).

Allow easy pairing between source and destination channels.

3. ⏸️ Per-Pair Task Control (Missing)
Implement the ability to:

Pause, Resume, Stop individual forwarding pairs directly from the dashboard.

Live status display (Active, Paused, Failed).

Real-time editing of forwarding pair settings (source, destination, delay) without deletion.

4. 📊 Bulk Management Tools (Missing)
Build options to:

Bulk add, bulk delete forwarding pairs.

Bulk pause/resume forwarding tasks.

5. 📑 Analytics & Reporting (Missing)
Implement exportable reports in CSV and PDF format.

Add custom analytics filters (by user, account, forwarding pair, time range).

Display success rates, failure rates, and forwarding volume.

6. 🔗 Webhook & API Key Management (Missing)
Build Webhook Event Broadcasting:

Allow forwarding events to be sent to external URLs in real time.

Build API Key Management:

Admin can generate secure API keys for third-party integration.

Enforce API key rate limits based on user plan.

7. 🚧 Telegram Anti-Ban System (Missing)
Build auto-throttling logic:

Monitor Telegram rate-limit signs.

Auto-reduce forwarding speed when API limits are being approached.

Add real-time system alerts for potential ban risks.

8. 🌍 Telegram Bot Multi-Language Support (Missing)
Build a /language command to switch Telegram bot language per user.

Initially support English, Hindi, Spanish (expandable in future).

9. 📝 SEO & Blog Management System (Missing)
Build an SEO-optimized blog system controlled via the admin panel:

Create, edit, delete blog posts.

Build sitemap auto-generation and Google ping system.

Add a meta tag and JSON-LD schema editor to boost SEO ranking.

Integrate Google Search Console API to view indexing reports inside the admin panel.

🛠️ Technical Requirements:
Backend: Python (FastAPI preferred)

Frontend: Tailwind CSS (Dark Theme, Mobile Responsive)

Database: PostgreSQL (preferred) or SQLite

Real-Time: Redis queue, async processing

Payments: PayPal (USD) and NowPayments (Crypto)

API: RESTful, async, fully documented

Security: IP Whitelisting, API rate limits, session encryption

✅ Critical Focus Points:
The Admin Panel must offer real-time system control, user management, error resolution, and SEO growth tools.

The User Dashboard must support visual joined channel selection, per-pair task management, and live status controls.

Real-time system monitoring, webhook integrations, API key security, and Telegram anti-ban measures must be fully operational.

All features must prioritize scalability, self-healing automation, and zero-downtime forwarding.
